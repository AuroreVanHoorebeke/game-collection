# CSS frameworks - Collections  

## About  
In this repository, you can find the resources for my first project done from scratch with a CSS framework.  
For this project, we were asked to create cards with basic infos about 10 videogames, songs, tv-shows or films.  
I chose to create cards about some games I play / I used to play or plan to play.  
The technology used is, of course, HTML, CSS and a CSS framework called [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).
